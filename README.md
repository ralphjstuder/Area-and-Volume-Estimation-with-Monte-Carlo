# Pi and Sphere Volume Monte Carlo Simulation with Simple Linear Regression

This program was built to analyze the accuracy of monte carlo simulations in estimating the volume of multidimensional figures. I ran a simple linear resgression using sci-kit learn, with the generated Monte Carlo data, to train a model for predicting the error of a simulation based on the number of points and the dimension.
